# Project 3: EDA for Real Estate Pricing

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Importing Libraries
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

### Step 2: Loading Data
Loaded the dataset using Pandas, performing initial exploration by displaying:
- The first few rows to understand the data structure.
- Information on column data types and non-null counts for a comprehensive overview.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning
This step focuses on preparing the dataset by handling missing values:
- **Identified columns with missing values** and inspected the extent of null values.
- **Handled missing values** appropriately for each column type:
  - For numerical columns, filled missing values with the mean or median.
  - For categorical columns, used the mode for imputation.
  
### Step 4: Data Type Conversion
Ensured proper data types for each column, converting where necessary to facilitate analysis.

### Step 5: Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Removed columns deemed non-essential for the analysis to streamline the dataset.

### Step 6: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset:
- **Distribution Analysis**: Checked the distribution and skewness of numerical columns.
- **Outlier Detection**: Applied methods such as the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify and potentially handle outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Created a correlation matrix to explore relationships between variables, with visualizations to highlight significant correlations.

### Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, ensuring the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further analysis or model development.
