## 🧭 Step-by-Step Process

---

### 🚀 Step 1  
### 🧰 Importing Libraries

The project begins by importing essential Python libraries:  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

---

### 📥 Step 2  
### 📂 Loading Data

Loaded the dataset using Pandas, performing initial exploration by displaying:  
- The first few rows to understand the data structure.  
- Information on column data types and non-null counts for a comprehensive overview.

---

### 🧼 Step 3  
### 🧹 Data Cleaning

This step focuses on preparing the dataset by handling missing values:  
- **Identified columns with missing values** and inspected the extent of null values.  
- **Handled missing values** appropriately for each column type:  
  - For numerical columns, filled missing values with the mean or median.  
  - For categorical columns, used the mode for imputation.

---

### 🔁 Step 4  
### 🏷️ Data Type Conversion

Ensured proper data types for each column, converting where necessary to facilitate analysis.

---

### 🧺 Step 5  
### 🗑️ Dropping Unnecessary Columns

Removed columns deemed non-essential for the analysis to streamline the dataset.

---

### 📊 Step 6  
### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset:  
- **Distribution Analysis**: Checked the distribution and skewness of numerical columns.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Applied methods such as the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify and potentially handle outliers.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Created a correlation matrix to explore relationships between variables, with visualizations to highlight significant correlations.

---

### 🧾 Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, ensuring the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further analysis or model development.
