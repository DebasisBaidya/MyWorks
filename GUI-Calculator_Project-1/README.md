This is a simple yet powerful calculator app I built using Python and Tkinter. It’s designed to be user-friendly while still offering a range of useful features.

## 🔧 Main Features

- ➕ **Basic Math**: You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- 🧠 **Advanced Functions**: It also handles square roots, trigonometric functions like sin, cos, and tan, and even squares and cubes.  
- 💹 **Percentage Calculations**: The calculator can easily handle percentages, making it great for things like tax or discount calculations.  
- ⚠️ **Error Messages**: If you try to do something that doesn’t make sense, like dividing by zero, the app will let you know with a helpful message.  
- 🎨 **Customizable Look**: The buttons are colorful, and the layout is designed to be clear and easy to use. Plus, you can resize the window as needed.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- 🧱 **Built with Tkinter**  
Tkinter handles all the parts you see and interact with, like buttons and the display.

- 🔢 **Math Operations**  
Python’s math module does the heavy lifting for all the calculations.

- 👆 **Button Clicks**  
The `on_button_click()` function is what makes the buttons work, updating the display and calculating results.
